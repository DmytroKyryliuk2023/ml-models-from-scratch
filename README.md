<h1>Machine Learning Models from Scratch</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project contains implementations of core machine learning algorithms built completely from scratch without relying on high-level ML libraries. The goal is to deepen understanding of how popular models work under the hood by coding them step by step. Each implementation focuses on clarity, mathematical intuition, and reusability.
